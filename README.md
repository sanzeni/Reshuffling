DISCLAIMER: The code here provided will generate simulations that have the elements to reproduce the figures in the paper. Nevertheless, those often involve simulating multiple networks and are the result of cluster output. 


DataAndScripts contains code for generating the unstructure model, the structure model and the dynamical mean field theory as well as the experimental data. These fucntions are called to the notebooks that you can find in the folders 1-MainTextFigures and 2-SuppFigures
